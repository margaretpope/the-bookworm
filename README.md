Welcome to The Bookworm! Readers of all levels are invited to create an account, search for the book they just finished reading, and add that book to their library. Watch your book count tally go up each time you finish a book! Enjoy tracking the books you have read or find some extra motivation to get back into reading.

The Bookworm uses a MySQL database, in conjunction with authentication, to render a specific user's saved books upon each login. Books are fetched using the Google Books API to get the cover art, title, and author of each book. The code is organized in an MVC file structure and implements Handlebars for HTML rendering. 

You can find the application [here](https://the-bookworm-c1a806da80c2.herokuapp.com). (For best results, open in Google Chrome.)
